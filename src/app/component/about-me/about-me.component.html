            Hi, I'm <span class="highlight">Ajay Chandrasekaran</span>, a curiosity-driven Front-End Developer.
            <br><br>I am passionate about bringing life to the visual and technical aspects of UI/UX designs.
        </p>

        <p>
            From getting excited about knowing how the web works and the curious creative process behind the designing
            and development of a web app, I started my career as a web developer in 2017. Determined to strike a balance
            between functional and UX design, I started with Angular (TypeScript and SCSS).
        </p>

        <p>I occasionally design or try to replicate UX design from the internet to pixel perfect websites.</p>

            <li>Node.js</li>
            <li>SCSS</li>
